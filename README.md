# Puzzle Vault

Welcome to Puzzle Vault — a small, beginner-friendly web app of riddles and puzzles created for learning and contribution.

## Features

- Simple, responsive UI (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Loads puzzles from `puzzles.json`
- Navigation (Next / Previous), answer checking, and a progress indicator

## Getting started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenSource-UIT/Hacktoberfest-25-4.git
cd Hacktoberfest-25-4
```

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder locally:

## How to use

- Read the puzzle displayed on the page
- Type your answer and click "Check Answer"
- Use "Show Answer" to reveal the solution (if available)
- Navigate using Next / Previous buttons

## Short list of issues (priority)

### High
- Puzzles not showing: the `showPuzzle()` function is currently disabled, so the UI does not populate puzzle text on load.
- Show Answer unresponsive: script queries `show-ans` but the button id is `show-answer`, so the listener isn't attached.
- Check Answer id typo: the Check button in HTML uses `chek-answer` (typo) and the script may not find it.

### Medium
- Progress indicator is invisible: `#progress` lacks a visible background color.
- Navigation edge-case: Next handler can set `currentIndex` to `puzzles.length` (off-by-one).

### Low
- Minor responsive styling improvements suggested for small screens.
